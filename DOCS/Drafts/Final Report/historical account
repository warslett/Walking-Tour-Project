Historical account of the project

The Project Plan was the first main event over the lifetime of the project. As a team we met up in various locations to discuss the main sections that needed to be completed for the deadline. In order to produce the first plan for the Project Plan, we firstly decided on the roles of each team member considering personal experiences within the fields. The very first hurdle that we tackled was the proposed system designs, figuring out the platforms and high level architecture that we were proposing to use and also the Use case diagrams for the android side and the server. These were mainly the tasks of the web and android teams. As well as the general design ideas, the both teams also had to create wireframes of the proposed GUI giving a reason why they chose these screens/pages. After each member of the team created written documents and image files of the design, the Management team then created the first draft of the document. During the same day, the web team had to change the use case diagram because of a few spelling mistakes with the actions.

The second main event was the Test Specification. All of the individuals in the group worked together for this document, to produce multiple tables and detailed descriptions of the tables. The android team worked along with the testing team in order to create module tests and system tests for the android device. And the web team also worked along side the testing team to create similar documents for the server side system tests. After all of the final documents were completed, the management team put the Test Specification PDF together ready for submission. After creating the first draft of the document the web and testing teams decided to change the server side test table because we had missed out a lot of important content.  

After creating the first two documents the team sat down and decided on how we were going to create the Design Specification. This became the busiest part of the project due to the detail that was needed from each team member. Knowing this, we all split into two groups; web and android team. The first main task within the design specification was the classes and components of the system; we planed to show structure and descriptions of them. One member of the android team designed all of the diagrams such as the component, sequence and UML class, whilst the other filled out the class or interface code with JavaDoc and comments. The web team also had to create a component and sequence diagram for the server side design. The second main task for the Design Specification was the Algorithms and data structures that we were proposing to use within the server and android sides.  The two main team members completed this part of the task
